- 👋 Hi, I’m @brinormus(Brian Norman)
- 👀 I originally was on a career path to be a front end web dev but found an interest in UX/UI so I am attending a bootcamp hosted by Georgia Tech in September of 2021.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, Figma, Adobe XD and more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and information with other designers and coders.
